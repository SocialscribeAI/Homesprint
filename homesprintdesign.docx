1️⃣ Brand Positioning Logic — “Bridge Market” Strategy

Goal: make the brand start in student communities (fast growth, trust loops) but look credible enough for landlords and non-student renters to adopt later — without rebranding.

→ Phase 1: Student-driven growth

Leverage the existing WhatsApp/student traction.

Keep tone friendly, energetic, community-based (“find home faster with real people”).

Push social proof: real faces, verified listings, transparent communication.

→ Phase 2: Broader Israeli rental market

Add layers of credibility and simplicity to attract families and professionals.

Keep the same color system, but let the tone mature — fewer emojis, more trust visuals, cleaner typography.

Core visual still fits both worlds (modern, neutral, Israel-wide).

2️⃣ Brand Essence (updated)

Brand Name: HomeSprint
Tagline: Find home faster.
Promise: Standardized, verified, and human rental connections — anywhere in Israel.
Vision: Simplify and humanize renting for every Israeli — starting where life starts: in the student and young adult market.
Core Values: Trust, Clarity, Community, Speed, Fairness.

3️⃣ Tone of Voice
Attribute	Description	Example
Friendly	Speak like a helpful local, not a corporate site.	“Your next home is closer than you think.”
Clear & Practical	Use real words, not tech jargon.	“Verified listings, clear prices, no surprises.”
Reliable	Sound transparent and professional.	“We check every listing before it goes live.”
Inclusive (EN/HE)	Fully bilingual tone; inclusive of religious, student, and professional audiences.	“בקלות תמצאו בית שמתאים בדיוק לכם.”
4️⃣ Visual Branding System — Unified Direction
🎨 Palette: “Trusted Modern Israel”

Designed to feel fresh for students yet trustworthy for landlords.

Color	Role	HEX
Midnight Blue	Primary (trust)	#13293D
Mint Green	Accent (speed/freshness)	#2AD5C1
Sandstone	Background / secondary neutral	#F3EDE4
Cloud White	Base background	#FAFAFA
Slate Gray	Text	#334155
Coral Orange	CTA / highlight	#FF7A59

The combination of cool trust colors (blue/gray) + warm accents (mint/coral) makes it inviting for both students and adults.

✍️ Typography

Latin: Manrope — geometric, approachable, tech-ready.

Hebrew: Rubik — matches weight and curve style beautifully.

Weights: 400 (body), 600 (UI labels), 700 (headers).

Spacing: generous line-height (1.6), strong information hierarchy.

🧩 Logo & Symbol

Wordmark: “HomeSprint” in Manrope Bold with a subtle forward-leaning italic S (hint of movement).

Mark/Icon: Stylized house + pin + checkmark — symbolizing “verified homes across Israel.”

Can be used standalone as an app icon.

Optional tagline lockup: Find home faster.

🧭 UI & Design Components

Buttons: Rounded 10–12px; Primary = Midnight Blue, hover = slightly lighter blue.

Cards: White or Sandstone background, 2px border #E5E7EB, soft shadow.

Icons: 2px rounded stroke, mint or coral accent.

Motion: 120–180ms ease-out, micro transitions (slide/fade), “Sprint” motif animation on load.

🏙 Imagery Style

Bright daylight interiors, student common areas, and real Israeli apartments — not stocky or fake.

Mix of students + young professionals + small families to show inclusivity.

Clean light tone, natural light, subtle mint overlays for brand consistency.

Israel recognizable in subtle details (tiles, architecture, sunlight tone).

📱 Brand Extension Rules

Works equally for “Student Hub” pages (e.g. Hebrew U, Bar Ilan) and “City Rentals” (Tel Aviv, Haifa).

Student sub-brand color accent → Mint Green.

General rental sub-brand accent → Coral Orange.

Everything else unified by same blue and typography.
